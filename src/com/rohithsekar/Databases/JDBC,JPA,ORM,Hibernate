JDBC, JPA, ORM, and Hibernate are all related to database access and management in Java applications, but they represent different technologies and
concepts. Here are the differences between these terms and how they are interlinked:

1. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):
JDBC is a Java API that provides a standard way to interact with relational databases. It allows Java applications to connect to a database, send SQL
queries, retrieve and manipulate data, and manage database transactions. JDBC provides a low-level, database-specific approach, where developers need to
write SQL statements and handle database-specific details manually.

2. JPA (Java Persistence API):
JPA is a Java specification for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). It provides a high-level, object-oriented approach to database access, allowing
developers to interact with databases using Java objects instead of writing SQL queries directly. JPA defines a set of annotations and APIs that map Java
objects to database tables and perform transparent data persistence and retrieval. It abstracts away the underlying database details and provides a
standard API for different ORM frameworks to implement.

3. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):
ORM is a programming technique that allows developers to map and manipulate objects in an object-oriented application to relational database tables. It
bridges the gap between the object-oriented paradigm of application development and the relational nature of databases. ORM frameworks provide tools and
libraries that automate the process of mapping objects to database tables, generating SQL queries, and handling the object-to-database conversion. They
abstract away the complexities of low-level database access, allowing developers to focus on the application's business logic.

4. Hibernate:
Hibernate is an open-source Java ORM framework that implements the JPA specification. It provides a powerful and flexible solution for object-relational
mapping and database access. Hibernate acts as an intermediary between the Java application and the database, managing the persistence of Java objects to
the database tables. It provides features like transparent object-to-database mapping, caching, lazy loading, and automatic SQL generation. Hibernate is
widely used in Java enterprise applications and is one of the most popular ORM frameworks available.

In terms of interlinking, JPA is a specification that defines a set of APIs and annotations for object-relational mapping, while Hibernate is an
implementation of the JPA specification. Hibernate provides the underlying ORM functionality and integrates with the JPA API. This means that you can use
Hibernate as the ORM provider when working with JPA. However, it's important to note that JPA is not limited to Hibernate, and there are other ORM
frameworks available that implement the JPA specification, such as EclipseLink and OpenJPA.

JDBC is a lower-level API that provides direct database access, and it can be used independently or alongside JPA and ORM frameworks. While JDBC requires
writing SQL queries and handling database-specific details manually, JPA and ORM frameworks like Hibernate abstract away these complexities and provide
higher-level abstractions for easier database interaction.

In summary, JDBC is the lowest-level API for database access, JPA is a specification for ORM, ORM is a programming technique for mapping objects to
databases, and Hibernate is an ORM framework that implements the JPA specification.
