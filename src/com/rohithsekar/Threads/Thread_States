The thread has certain states from the moment it has been created until it is effectively dead.

1. NEW                       When the thread is created, it is the new state.

2. RUNNABLE                  From the moment we invoke the start method upon a thread, and till it gets the Scheduler
                             time to begin executing the run method, it will be in a runnable state.

3. RUNNING                   When the CPU space is actually provided to the thread, the thread starts executing, and it
                             is said to be in the Running state.

4. WAITING                   When the thread is in waiting/blocked mode by invoking certain methods such as wait(), join(),
                             sleep(), the thread goes into waiting state.

5. DEAD                      When the thread has finished executing/explicitly stopped, it is in the dead state.
