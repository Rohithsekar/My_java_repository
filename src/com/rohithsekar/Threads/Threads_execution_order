In Java, the order in which threads are started and executed is not guaranteed, even if they are started
sequentially in the main thread. When you start multiple threads in Java, the thread scheduler determines the
actual order of thread execution based on factors such as thread priorities, thread scheduling policies, and the
availability of system resources. The thread scheduler is part of the operating system or the underlying Java
runtime environment, and its behavior may vary across different platforms and implementations.

Even if you start the threads sequentially in the main thread, there is no guarantee that they will be executed in
the same order. The scheduler may decide to execute one thread before the other, or it may interleave the
execution of multiple threads based on its own scheduling algorithm. Therefore, you cannot rely on the
sequential order of thread creation to determine the order of thread execution. If the order of execution is
important in your application, you should use proper synchronization mechanisms or coordination techniques,
such as locks, semaphores, or barriers, to control the execution order of threads and ensure the desired behavior.

Consider the following code snippet:

public class Need_For_Volatile
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException //may throw
    {
        Worker worker = new Worker(); //Worker is a class implementing Runnable interface
        Thread t = new Thread(worker);
        t.start();

        Thread.sleep(1000); // Wait for 1 second
        worker.halt(); // Request the worker thread to halt
    }
}
 //Is there any chance the second statement gets executed first? Again, Thread is a class and sleep is its method.
  //Which thread will be put to sleep for 1 second?
//Here there is only two threads(main thread and the "t" thread.)

There is a chance that the second statement, Thread.sleep(1000), gets executed before the first statement,
thread.start(). However, the exact behavior depends on the thread scheduling done by the underlying operating
system and Java runtime environment.

When you call thread.start(), it creates a new thread of execution and invokes the run() method of the thread.
This newly created thread may or may not start immediately, as it depends on the thread scheduler.
On the other hand, Thread.sleep(1000) is a static method that causes the currently executing thread
(in this case, the main thread) to sleep for the specified duration (1 second in this case). It DOES NOT AFFECT
the execution of other threads.

Therefore, in most cases, the second statement (Thread.sleep(1000)) will be executed first, and the main thread
(the thread executing the code) will be put to sleep for 1 second. After the sleep duration, the main thread
resumes execution and continues to the next statement.The newly created thread (thread) may or may not start
during this 1-second sleep period.(Depends whether there are other threads).Its execution depends on various
factors such as thread scheduling, system resources, and the complexity of the code within the run() method.

It's important to note that the order of execution between threads is not deterministic and can vary between
different runs of the program or on different systems. To ensure specific execution order or synchronization
between threads, you would need to use appropriate synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, or
barriers.
