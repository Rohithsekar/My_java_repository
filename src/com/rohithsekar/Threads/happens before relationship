The happens-before relationship is a concept in the Java Memory Model (JMM) that defines the ordering of actions
in concurrent programs. It establishes guarantees about the visibility and ordering of memory accesses between
different threads.

In Java, the happens-before relationship ensures that certain actions in one thread are visible to another thread.
If an action A happens-before another action B, it means that the effects of A are visible to B. This ensures
that changes made by one thread are correctly observed by other threads in a predictable and consistent manner.

The happens-before relationship is based on the following rules:

Program order rule: Actions in a single thread occur in the order defined by the program.

Monitor lock rule: An unlock on a monitor lock happens-before any subsequent lock on the same monitor lock.

Volatile variable rule: A write to a volatile variable happens-before any subsequent read of that variable.

Thread start rule: A thread's start() method happens-before any actions in the started thread.

Thread termination rule: Any actions in a thread happen-before actions in any other thread that detects the
thread has terminated.

Interruption rule: A thread calling interrupt() on another thread happens-before the interrupted thread detects
the interruption.

Finalizer rule: The end of an object's constructor happens-before the start of its finalizer.

Transitive synchronization rule: If action A happens-before action B, and action B happens-before action C, then
action A happens-before action C.

These rules define the guarantees provided by the JMM for the ordering and visibility of actions between threads.
They help ensure that the behavior of concurrent programs is predictable and consistent.

By understanding the happens-before relationship and applying appropriate synchronization mechanisms, such as
synchronized blocks, volatile variables, or explicit synchronization using locks, you can create correct and
reliable concurrent programs in Java.
